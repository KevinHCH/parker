Given that these metrics are used during live broadcasts, the system must be both extremely fast and highly robust, as any drop in service during a live broadcast is unacceptable. \n\nPlease address the following questions in your cover letter:\n1. How would you design a cloud-based architecture to ensure near real-time processing of video clips with minimal latency?\n2. What experience do you have in deploying large-scale AI models (e.g., pose estimation or detection models) on GPU-accelerated servers? \n3. How would you approach implementing horizontal scaling for the distributed workload, especially ensuring frame distribution across multiple GPU servers?\n4. Describe a strategy for monitoring and alerting in a system that must operate continuously during live broadcasts. How would you minimize downtime / add redundancy in case of component failures?\n\nPlease send in a cover letter describing your interest in the project and answer the screening questions to the best of your ability. You will receive the full project scope upon cover letter review."
